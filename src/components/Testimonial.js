      "I was off the road for approximately 10 years. Having moved to Richmond
      from NYC, I needed to overcome my trauma with a prior accident and drive
      myself around. Abigail's driving school empowered me in ways that words
      fail to capture. Please ask for Mr. Mohamed who is patient, understanding,
      but firm as he will ensure your safety on the road. I appreciated his down
      to earth demeanor and ability to eliminate any of my concerns. Learn with
      Abigail, you won't fail."
