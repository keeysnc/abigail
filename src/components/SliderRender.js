              "I was off the road for approximately 10 years. Having moved to
              Richmond from NYC, I needed to overcome my trauma with a prior
              accident and drive myself around. Abigail's driving school
              empowered me in ways that words fail to capture. Please ask for
              Mr. Mohamed who is patient, understanding, but firm as he will
              ensure your safety on the road. I appreciated his down to earth
              demeanor and ability to eliminate any of my concerns. Learn with
              Abigail, you won't fail."

              "It was very hard finding a school in the Richmond area that was
              able to deliver a driver education in Spanish for my mother. The
              staff at Abigail's Driving School have been amazing at helping my
              mom obtain her driving license. Since then, I have had both my
              twin sons go to their school. Their schedule is flexible, and are
              the only ones i know of in the Richmond area that will work with
              your budget. Hope they stay in business for a long time. I have an
              8 year old that will need to learn how to drive. Thank you!"

              "This class was very helpful and family friendly environment. I
              was nervous that this class wouldnâ€™t help me get my learners after
              I failed 3 times but I passed after attending their class. I would
              recommend this school to anyone."

              "I initially came here because of the irony that the title had my
              name. But what I found was far more fulfillinging than I could
              have anticipated. It didn't only improve my driving but it was a
              confidence booster which seems goes hand in hand with being a good
              driver. I've learned you must be "comfortable with your decision
              making skills, in order to be a safe driver." This concept helped
              to alleviate my anxiety and I am forever grateful for attending
              Abigail's driving school. After years of procrastination and doubt
              that i could ever be a driver, I now can say I finally have my
              license. Because of this experience, I am now a strong believer
              and advocate that with the right guidance any one can learn to
              drive. Luckily I found mine, I would definitely recommend
              Abigail's Driving School."

              "Excellent just excellent, so patient and help you study to the
              point that you would be able to learn it and remember it very
              quickly. I love Mohamed and really appreciated everything you do
              with your clients. I've never met someone who was so determined to
              help you pass the test. He will help you everyday if he has to
              until you go down to DMV and take the test. I would recommend
              anybody to him. Thank you so much friend, you're the best."

              "The instructor was professional yet friendly and worked with my
              busy schedule so I could complete the course as an adult driver.
              He ensured I knew the material before moving forward-some of which
              I was not aware of as a foreigner and proved to be very helpful
              with regards to road safety. Thank you for all your help!"
