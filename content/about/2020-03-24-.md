  Abigail’s Driving School was started in 2012 by two Virginia Commonwealth
  University students. After both received traffic infractions, they had to
  attend a court mandated driver improvement class. During this class, they
  noticed Spanish speakers had to get an interpreter, which meant they would pay
  for the interpreter in addition to the class. The students were inspired to
  create a driving school which was able to provide classes in Spanish and
  English at a reasonable price. As a result, Abigail's Driving School has since
  become the only English-and-Spanish-language driving school provider in the
  Richmond Metropolitan area. 


  Not only do we strive to overcome language barriers but also work hard to
  deliver the highest quality of customer service. We teach individuals
  defensive driving, regardless of age or experience. This consists of
  decreasing anxiety through practice, reinforcement and achieving customized
  goals. Our instructors have successfully passed an in-depth driving/criminal
  history check, are certified and licensed to teach by the Virginia Department
  of Motor Vehicles. Abigail’s Driving School is authorized, bonded, insured and
  certified by the Department of Motor Vehicles of Virginia. Vision: To become a
  household name in Virginia by ensuring each student can drive safely drive out
  on the streets and the in real world while facing different variable and
  dangers from their surrounding environment. Mission: To provide a learning
  friendly environment that consists of decreasing anxiety through practice,
  reinforcement and achieving customized goals.
