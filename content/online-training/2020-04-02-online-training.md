#### How It Works

* The program consists of at least 30 hours of instructions and includes components about alcohol safety, drug abuse awareness, aggressive driving, distracted driving, pedestrian and bicycle safety, handicapped parking, fuel efficient driving practices, motorcycle awareness and organ and tissue donation awareness as required by law.
* You must be at least 15 years and 6 months old to take the online driver education course. All individuals who elect to take the classroom component of the driver education course online must take the online course through a DMV licensed driver training school. Homeschooled students are exempt from this requirement.
* In order to benefit from the course, you must be able to work independently and be comfortable with using a computer.

#### Testing procedures:

On the day of testing, you must bring the following to the test site:

* Photo identification (DMV issued identification card, school issued identification card, valid passport or military identification)
* Proof of completion of the on-line driver education course
* A completed “Parental Consent for Online Driver Education Examination” ([dts62](http://www.safedrivingacademy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dts62.pdf)), if you are under age 18. You can download it from here.

  *The online driver training school - Abigail´s Driving School- will provide a computer for testing.*

1. The student logs in and begins the approved online course as instructed.
2. The student receives a directive to return to Abigail’s Driving School to take the final exam. The student is given written verification of completion of the theory portion of driver education. This document verifies to the affiliate school that the student has completed this portion of the course and is ready to take the final exam.
3. Abigail’s Driving School´s licensed instructor logs into the course and opens the testing site for each student who presents the written verification of completion document entering their **seven digit student authorization code**.
4. The student takes the final examination **online** in the presence of the licensed instructor.
5. The course grades the test and reveals the results. If the student passes the course, the instructor will receive the certificate of completion for that student and can continue with the behind-the-wheel portion of the course or issue the certificate to the student when there is a request to transfer. If the student fails the examination, the student will be allowed to review any section of the completed course to prepare to take the examination again.
