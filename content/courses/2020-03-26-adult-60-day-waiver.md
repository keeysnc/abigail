Individuals who are 18 years of age and older who have never held any U. S. state issued driver’s license, must hold their Virginia learner’s permit for 60 days prior to being eligible to take the road
test at DMV. To waive the requirement to hold the permit for 60 days, the
individual can complete a state-approved driver’s education program - also known as the 60-Day
Waiver. Upon completion, the school will conduct your road test. This course is identical to the teen
driver’s education program.
