string: ' Eight-Hour Driver Improvement Clinic'
---
The driver improvement clinic educates and refreshes both new and experienced drivers about defensive driving techniques in order to minimize risk. We are State of Virginia DMV Approved and Licensed.

**Program:**Our driver improvement course uses the **[National Traffic Safety Institute](https://ntsi.com/about-ntsi/)**(NTSI) Defensive Driving Program. NTSI is one of the first defensive driving programs established in 1974. Abigail's Driving School follows NTSI's belief that values + attitude = behavior. It is through personal responsibility that has the potential to modify driving behaviors.

**Reasons for why you would take this class:**

**Voluntarily:**If the course is taken voluntarily, you will receive**up to five safe driving points**towards your driving record.

**Court:**If the court assigns you to take this course you will not receive any safe driving points unless you have a court document stating otherwise. However, it will help you with a ticket.

**DMV:**If instructed by the DMV to take the class, you will receive driving points depending on your current record. Verify with**[Virginia DMV.](https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/#/)**
